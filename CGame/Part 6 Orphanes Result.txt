7 3 1 *Name*: What’s the dungeon quest about?  Bertha: The town funds that one.  It doesn’t offer to much gold, since it doesn’t have a lot to spare.  Recently we been having a lot of attacks recently, more than usual, and more orderly.  We think the local monsters are taking orders from someone or something, at the dungeon in the Hallow Forest not to far away from here.  Again, it doesn’t pay match, but it is kind of urgent because its becoming more consistent, and a lot of our guards are dying. We would appreciate if you can take care of it for us?
